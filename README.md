Aspiring SOC Analyst | Building Skills for 2025

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Andr√© Almeida, and I'm on a journey to become a skilled Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst by 2026. This repository showcases my ongoing projects, learning, and skill development in key areas of cybersecurity.

**Future Projects:**

* **Mini-SOC Environment:** Building and configuring a home lab to simulate a real-world SOC environment. I'm focusing on setting up SIEM tools (Splunk/ELK), log analysis, and alert correlation.
* **Security Automation:** Developing Python and Bash scripts to automate security tasks, such as log parsing, vulnerability scanning, and incident response workflows.
* **Threat Hunting:** Practicing threat hunting techniques using tools like Wireshark, Suricata/Snort, and Zeek. I'm focusing on identifying malicious patterns and anomalies in network traffic and logs.
* **Incident Response Drill:** Simulating incident response scenarios to practice containment, eradication, and recovery procedures. I'm documenting my findings and lessons learned.
